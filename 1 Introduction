1 Introduction

	Money-related reward is common across many industries and many people also think that higher pay may leads to higher performance nowadays. According to Ariely.D, Gneezy.U, Loewenstein.G, and Mazar.N. (2009) large stakes and big mistakes, the review of Economic studies, 76(2) 451-169, “indeed there are some evidence that payment for performance can increase performance (Lazear, 2000)”. But we think there are people who are doing cognitive jobs and most of them have high salary every month. Maybe money related reward can not attract them well. So in this paper, we will introduce a theory called Pink’s solution (1943) which gives a way to motivate these cognitive employees in order to create more value for companies.
	In this paper, Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs (1943) and the concept of cognitive cost (Mike, 2010) will be used to explain the reason why cognitive employees may not be attracted by money-related rewards or even do their job worse. Moreover, Pink’s new theory on motivation (2009) will be used to solve how to motivate cognitive employees. 
	At the beginning of this paper, we will talk about the real life problems that manager may face. Next, this paper will give a throughout explanation about why money-related reward may not be attractive on cognitive employees by using Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs (1943) and the concept of cognitive cost (Mike, 2010). Third, Pink’s new theory on motivation (2009) will give a solution on these problems we mentioned before. And the activity we did in class will be introduced and analyzed. Last, we will do a conclusion to discuss limitations about our report and give some suggestions.
